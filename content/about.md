Hello hello! This is my technical blog. My interests are in

- Software development
- Software Infrastucture
- Cybersecurity

Professionally, I work in software supply chain security and personally I like
building and hosting software I can use at home. The blog contents are my
passing thoughts around those areas for the most part.
