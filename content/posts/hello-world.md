For a long time my domain name, public usernames and social
media accounts have all had my real name. The handle `cmp0st` is
a shift away from having my personal details (face, real name etc) out there.

Working in tech there has been a big benefit to using my real name because all 
my code and articles have all built up into a portfolio I can share.
