For a long time my domain name, public usernames and social
media accounts have all had my real name. The handle `cmp0st` is
a shift away from having my personal details (face, real name etc) out there.

Working in tech, there has been a big benefit to using my real name because all
my code and articles have all built up into a portfolio I can share. Thankfully
my career has gathered enough momentum at this point that I don't have to work that
much on a public profile any more so here we are!

I'm finding that there is something refreshing about having less of my personal
information out there. I work in cybersecurity so perhaps it is the natural
flow of things to eventually drift toward anonymity over time as a defensive
measure.

That said, maybe I just wanted the delightful greenfield of a new domain name ðŸª´
